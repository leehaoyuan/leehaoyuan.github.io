I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student advised by [Dr. Snigdha Chaturvedi](https://sites.google.com/site/snigdhac/home) at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I hold a B.S. in Statistics from Renmin University of China and an M.S. in Health Data Science from Harvard University. My research interests broadly span summarization, interpretability, fairness, evaluation, and reinforcement learning. I am honored to be the recipient of the NAACL 2025 SAC Award.
