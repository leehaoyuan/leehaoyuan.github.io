I am the first-year Ph.D. student advised by [Dr. Snidha Chaturvedi](https://sites.google.com/site/snigdhac/home) at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I got my B.S. in Statistics at Renmin University of China. I got my M.S. in Health Data Science at Harvard University. Currently, my research interest is summarization and few-shot learning.
